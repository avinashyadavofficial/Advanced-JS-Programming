// Imagine you're ordering pizza  from a pizza place that also does burgers , and the drinks .
//  You want everything, and you want to make sure that after getting the pizza you can get the burger and
//   finally the drink â€“ all in sequence!

// Promise chaining is exactly that! Instead of waiting in separate queues for each task to finish,you link each task 
// together in a single chain. The key here is that each step of the promise passes along the result 
// to the next one in the chain.
