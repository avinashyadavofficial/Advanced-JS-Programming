#  Advanced JS Programming

Welcome to the **Advanced JavaScript Programming** sprint!  
This sprint is designed to deepen your knowledge of **data structures**, **algorithms**, and **advanced JavaScript concepts**, enabling you to write efficient, clean, and professional-level code.

---

## Sprint Goals

By the end of this sprint, you will be able to:

- Solve real-world problems using key data structures and algorithms
- Master JavaScript objects, inheritance, and prototypes
- Work confidently with Promises, async/await, and error handling
- Understand memory management and advanced object features
- Apply modern JS techniques like currying, hoisting, and microtasks

---

## Topics Covered

### Data Structures & Algorithms

- **Linear Structures:**  
  - Arrays, Linked Lists, Stacks, Queues
- **Non-Linear Structures:**  
  - Trees (BST, Binary Trees), Graphs
- **Hashing:**  
  - Hash Tables for fast key-value lookups
- **Searching Algorithms:**  
  - Linear Search, Binary Search, BFS, DFS
- **Sorting Algorithms:**  
  - Bubble Sort, Merge Sort, Heap Sort, and more
- **Structured vs Unstructured Data:**  
  - Practice with different data formats

---

### Advanced JavaScript Concepts

#### Objects & Classes
- Object creation, references, and copying
- Constructors, `this` keyword, and the `new` operator
- Optional chaining (`?.`) and object to primitive conversions

####  Object Internals
- Property descriptors and flags
- Getters and setters
- Prototypes and inheritance
- Native prototypes and prototype-less objects

#### Class Inheritance
- Class-based OOP in JavaScript
- Extending built-in classes

---

### Asynchronous JavaScript

- Promises, chaining, and error handling
- `Promise.all`, `Promise.race`, and other Promise APIs
- Custom error classes and extending `Error`
- Promisification of callback-based functions
- Async/await syntax and patterns
- Async iteration and generators

---

###  Functional and Execution Concepts

- Currying and function transformations
- Hoisting and execution context
- Callbacks and callback hell
- Event loop and microtasks

---

## Tools & Technologies

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- Node.js for running and testing code
- Debugging tools (DevTools, VS Code)
- Online judges (e.g., LeetCode, HackerRank â€“ optional for practice)

---

## Expected Outcomes

- Solid grasp of core and advanced JS features
- Ability to implement and analyze efficient algorithms
- Confidence in writing clean, readable, and performant JavaScript
- Preparedness for technical interviews and real-world coding tasks
